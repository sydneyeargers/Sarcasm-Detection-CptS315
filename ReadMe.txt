Notes: 

-Please be patient with this program! It is as fast as it can be, but takes time because it has to train and test ~30 models. This project is investigative and educational in nature, and therefore creating many models is important for the integrity of the project.

-The program pauses whenever a new plot is created. Please press the red 'x' in the top corner of the figure to continue the program. (Please note, for ease of understanding from plot to plot, the plot window will remain open after the x is clicked, but the program will resume.)

-Please see console output WHILE the program is running for information regarding metrics for each epoch and early stopping, as well as program progress.

-Please see console output AFTER the program has run for information regarding runtime and model accuracies.
